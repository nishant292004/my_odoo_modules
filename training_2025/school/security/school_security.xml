    <!-- Creating Groups -->

    <!-- To create a group we will use the record tag and the model will be res.groups -->

    <!-- Administrator Group -->
    <record id="grp_school_admin" model="res.groups">
        <field name="name">School Administrator</field>
    </record>

    <!-- Teacher Group -->
    <record id="grp_school_teacher" model="res.groups">
        <field name="name">School Teacher</field>
    </record>

    <!-- Student Group -->
    <record id="grp_school_student" model="res.groups">
        <field name="name">School Student</field>
    </record>

    <!-- Details of ir.model.access.csv file -->
    <!-- The CSV file is basically a text file but can be opened either with text editor or an Xls editor (Excel, Libre Calc, Numbers) -->
    <!-- The first line in the file are the fields for access rights -->
    <!-- The access rights are stored in the model ir.model.access hence the name of the file is ir.model.access.csv -->
    <!--The first field is id similar to our id field in the xml so we will call it xml id only -->
    <!-- NOTE: The xml id is also called External ID -->
    <!-- The naming convention is access_<model_name>_<group_name>_<additional_string> -->
    <!-- The second field is the name which is the name of the access right -->
    <!-- The naming convention is similar to id but '_' replaced by '.' -->
    <!-- The third field is the model_id:id which is the XML ID (External ID) of the model for which the access right is to be given-->
    <!-- The XML ID of the model is automatically defined when you create it in the python file -->
    <!-- It is always model_<name_of_the_model_>('.' replaced by '_') -->
    <!-- The fourth field is the group_id:id which is the XML ID (External ID) of the group to which the access right is to be given -->
    <!-- This will be the xml ID of the group which you have defined in the Security's XML file -->
    <!-- The next 4 are the Permission fields perm_read, perm_write, perm_create, perm_unlink which are boolean fields -->
    <!-- the values are either 0 or 1. Where 1 means we are giving the access and 0 means we are not giving the access -->
    <!-- perm_read is a field for Reading Permission -->
    <!-- perm_write is a field for Reading Permission -->
    <!-- perm_create is a field for Reading Permission -->
    <!-- perm_unlink is a field for Reading Permission -->
